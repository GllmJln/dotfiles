# Dotfiles

Personal dotfiles. Configs for some of the programs I use. \
Of course these are a work in progress, although the work on dotfiles never really stops. Just don't want to loose all these settings/configs if my computer dies.

GNU stow is recommended for insallation of these dotfiles as there is no automatic symlink script. Also GNU stow is better and makes maintaining dotfiles easier.

# DISCLAMER

Basically do not install these dotfiles. I will not accept any responsibility for any damage to anything caused by installation of these files. These are really intended for my personal use only.

Why would you want to insall them anyways?
